With the largest number of undergrads in the country you would think it would be easy to get involved and find people with similar interests as you, but it can actually be quite daunting. Newer students and even some upperclassmen struggle to feel connected to their campus and student body. With the Ig-Knight app students can find people to study with, clubs that may interest them, and even student deals around the campus. Ig-Knight allows you to put in your course load and find students with similar study habits as you to work with. The app will also show you upcoming events around UCF that you may want to attend to further your involvement. Although a lot of what we provide is already available to students on the internet, it is very spread out and can be difficult to find for students unfamiliar with the sites. Our product offers all of this information in one place through a user friendly app.
