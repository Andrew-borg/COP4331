## COP 4331C
### UCF - Spring 2020


# **Product Vision**
### [Project Proposal](https://github.com/h3rmi0n3/COP4331/blob/master/project/ProjectProposal.md)

With UCF having the _largest population of undergraduate students in the nation_ and _more than 600 registered student-run organizations_, it _should be easy_ to find a group of like-minded students to make college life easier and more fun. However, with our team consisting of UCF students, _we know that this is far from the truth_. 

Between all of the different UCF websites, various information platforms, and even their own mobile app, _it can be problematic_ for freshmen, and even for seniors, to make the most of their time at this university. 

- Collaborating with students that share similar classes, professors, and even ideas, can be _extremely challenging_. 
- Searching for and joining a club is a long set of tasks in itself, with no guarantee of finding that one organization that can change your life. 
- Simply looking for the correct information to a wide range of problems that students have every day is troublesome and disheartening when it's no where to be found. 

Our team is aiming to spark the **igKnight** platform in order to solve these problems that plague the lives for many of our peers. **igKnight** is a mobile (_Android only at this time_) student companion/lite social media application that aims to help students during their undergraduate journey. 

With our application, students will be capable of finding and collaborating with students that share similar characteristics, can easily find some of the most requested information geared towards students (_ie. student discounts, academic forms, etc._), and find a calendar with upcoming UCF-related events which will be tailored towards each individuals major and preferences. **igKnight** will give students the fuel needed to excel through their academic career and connect, not only to information, but to people, which is what every aspiring student's goal should be.

Although a lot of what we provide is already available to students on the internet, **it is very spread out and can be difficult to find**, especially for students unfamiliar with the sites. Unlike the existing functionalities in WebCourses, KnightConnect, and various business' websites, the **igKnight** platform would collect _all of this information and these functions in one easy to use Android application_, bringing all the tools to involve yourself, _right to your fingertips_.
