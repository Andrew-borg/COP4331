#### Blake's Proposal:

With the largest number of undergrads in the country you would think it would be easy to get involved and find people with similar interests as you, but it can actually be quite daunting. Newer students and even some upperclassmen struggle to feel connected to their campus and student body. With the Ig-Knight app students can find people to study with, clubs that may interest them, and even student deals around the campus. Ig-Knight allows you to put in your course load and find students with similar study habits as you to work with. The app will also show you upcoming events around UCF that you may want to attend to further your involvement. Although a lot of what we provide is already available to students on the internet, it is very spread out and can be difficult to find for students unfamiliar with the sites. Our product offers all of this information in one place through a user friendly app. 

#### Chloë's Proposal:
- The product is going to be an Android Mobile Application called **igKnight**. **igKnight** will give UCF students access to nearby discounts, events that are occuring at UCF, and a Study Buddy matching system.


#### Jon's Proposal:

- With a staggering number of undergraduate students and student-run organizations, it should be easy to find a group of like-minded students to make college life easier and more fun. However, with our team consisting of UCF students, we know that this is far from the truth. Between all of the different UCF websites, various information platforms, and even their own mobile app, it's problematic for freshmen and seniors alike to make the most of their time at this university. It's challenging to collaborate with students that share similar classes, professors, and even ideas. Searching for and joining a club is a long set of tasks in itself with no guarantee of finding that one organization that can change your life. Even just looking for the correct information to a wide range of problems that students have every day is troublesome and disheartening when it's no where to be found. Our team is aiming to spark the igKnight platform in order to solve these problems that plague the lives for many of our peers. igKnight is a mobile (Android only at this time) student companion/lite social media application that aims to help students during their undergraduate journey. With our app, students will be capable of finding and collaborating with students that share similar characteristics, can easily find some of the most requested information geared towards students (ie. student discounts, academic forms, etc.), and find a calendar with upcoming UCF-related events which will be tailored towards each individuals major and preferences. igKnight will give students the fuel needed to excel through their academic career and connect, not only to information, but to people, which is what every aspiring student's goal should be.

#### Andrew's Proposal:

- For students at UCF who either struggle to get connected to or involved with the community, or want to do so more deeply and with greater ease, igKnight will make an easy way for students to connect with classmates, form study groups with like minded others, find student organizations and events, and even find deals on or near campus, all together in one place. This leads, then, to the student body on average becoming more involved with the community, as it greatly lowers the effort required to accomplish the same tasks as it is now. Unlike the existing functionality in webcourses, knightconnect, and various business' websites, the igKnight service would collect all of these functions and information in one easy to use android that brings all the tools to involve yourself right to your fingertips.
